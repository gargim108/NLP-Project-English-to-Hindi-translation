## NLP Attention English-to-Hindi Translator

### Overview

This repository contains an attention-based machine translation model specifically tailored for translating text from Hindi to English. The model leverages attention mechanisms to improve translation quality by dynamically focusing on different parts of the input text during the translation process. This approach significantly enhances the model's ability to handle complex sentence structures and idiomatic expressions.

### Key Features
- Attention Mechanism: The model employs an attention mechanism to capture relevant information from the source sentence, resulting in more accurate translations.
- Bidirectional LSTM: Utilizes bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers for better context understanding.
- Custom Dataset: Trained on a diverse dataset of Hindi and English sentence pairs for comprehensive language coverage.

### Usage
To use this attention-based translation model, you can:

- Clone the repository and follow the provided instructions for setting up the environment.
- Employ the trained model for Hindi to English translation in your own projects or applications.
-Fine-tune the model on custom datasets for domain-specific translations.

### Model Performance
The attention model has been evaluated using standard translation evaluation metrics, such as BLEU scores and perplexity, achieving competitive results for Hindi to English translation tasks.
